JavaScript Challenge

This script generates a random password that asks user for various char types. In order for this to run as expected please only answer in 'YES'/'yes' or 'NO'/'no'. This script only works with 1 type of no, in other words you must say yes/YES to all except for 1 or all yes.

[Please see my application in:](./index.html)
